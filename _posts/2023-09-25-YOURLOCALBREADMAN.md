Since the last post, you probably figured out that I am a sucker for weird things like horrors beyond your imagination, weird atistic styles, VHS-type horror, and so on. WELL, I DISCOVERED MORE!


This one is really unique. I have never seen anything like it, so I will give you a few videos I think are the highlights of the channel and then talk about what I think.

Did I mention his videos are funny in a way? No? huh...

This one has to be one of my favorites (Not the music but the visuals)

Now, I know what you are thinking. "This is weird just for the sake of being weird," and I can't make an argument because I myself don't really know what is going on, BUT I LOVE IT! It's in a limbo between VHS horror and Trevor Henderson's creations, with a little bit of cartoonish horror sprayed over it. I highly recommend looking into his channel; his content is UNAPPRECIATED, and his most-viewed video only has 50k views. THAT'S PURE INJUSTICE!
