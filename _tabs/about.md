# Hello!

I am SadAways! What? That doesn't tell you anything? Alr...


I am a bad artist who wants to get better!


I am a developer who cant really make anything on his own but likes playing with things other people made and tweak them a little, also wants to get better!


I am a person who studies at a middle school, I want to complete it!


I play minecraft, I suck at it but don't want to improve because its funny that way.


Just to sum it up I am your ordinary, run of the mill guy on the internet who loves to make things but is bad at everything.


I will use this website of mine to post art, memes, videos and updates about my life, tho my life is boring so expect like 1 post about my life per year and even that will just be "uhh yeah I am alive... h-have this veri funni meme wich is just cropped porn". But because my art sucks its just an archive for it.


### Anyway here are some things I want to qualify:

1. When the post has a "not original" tag it means I have found an image and tried copying it on paper.
